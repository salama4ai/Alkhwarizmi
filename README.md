The Wake Word Listener's job is to continually listen to sounds and speech around the Device, and activate when the sounds or speech match a Wake Word.
Mycroft provides an open source Wake Word Listener called Precise. which i will use in this project to train a model to wake up when it hears certain word
Precise is the default Wake Word Listener and handles detection of "Hey Mycroft" for the majority of Mycroft Users.
