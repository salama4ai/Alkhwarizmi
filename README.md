Mycroft Precise is fully open source and can be trined to recognize anything from a name to a cough. Precise is a wake word listener. The software monitors an audio stream ( usually a microphone ) and when it recognizes a specific phrase it triggers an event. When the software recognizes this phrase it puts the rest of Mycroft's software into command mode and waits for a command from the person using the device.

The Wake Word Listener's job is to continually listen to sounds and speech around the Device, and activate when the sounds or speech match a Wake Word. Mycroft provides an open source Wake Word Listener called Precise. which i used in this project to train a model to wake up when it hears hey-savant.
